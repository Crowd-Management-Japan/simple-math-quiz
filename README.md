# Single Digit Addition Task
The single-digit addition task can be used to distract people in experiments, consequently impairing their cognitive attention in relation to external tasks. This simple app is designed to distract people while using a smartphone. Simple addition problems are presented, and individuals need to answer by writing the solution. The number of problems solved and the amount of correct solutions are stored. Type "000" to access the hidden page showing the results. On the hidden page, click "RESET" to reset the results, "RETURN" to return to the main window, and "SAVE RESULTS" to export the results through copy-paste (you may want to copy them into a text file). "Advanced mode" accounts for the time spent while typing the answer. To avoid that two-digit answers (i.e., 11 or 13) take more time to write, only the last digit needs to be provided as a solution (i.e., 1 or 3). "Allow skipping" simply allows people to skip questions.

# Why this?

# Security
You may need to 'force' your phone to install this app since it is not available through the Google Play store. We are not aware of any risks, and the code has been written from scratch in Android Studio. However, you install the app at your own risk.
